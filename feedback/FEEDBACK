Please look at the general comments to see if any apply.

Good set of tests.

Good documentation.

Consider using the ?: operator rather than code like:

@Override
  public int compareTo(Object o) {
    Contact c = (Contact) o;
    if (contactId == c.getId() && contactName.compareTo(c.getName()) == 0
            && contactNotes.compareTo(c.getNotes()) == 0) {
      return 0;
    } else {
      return -1;
    }
  }

Going forward consider using Java 8 constructs.

An excellent piece of work - well done.
